# Lie-Detector-Stress-Detector
The Lie Detector is a mini-project aimed at creating a hardware-based tool to monitor physiological indicators of stress. By integrating multiple sensors such as a pulse sensor, GSR electrodes, and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, the system provides an innovative way to identify potential signs of stress.
